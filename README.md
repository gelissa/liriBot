# liriBot

LiriBot is a language-interface bot contained within the terminal which will search across the internet (Spotify, Bands in Town, and OMDB) for information about different types of entertainement. 

## What does she do?

She uses four command-line arguments:
1. `concert-this`

2. `spotify-this-song`

3. `movie-this`

4. `do-what-it-says`

Using these, she performs API calls and outputs them to the terminal.
